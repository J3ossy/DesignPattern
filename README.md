## Principles of good software design

***S**ingle Responsibility Principle:* Each class should have only one responsibility.

***O**pen-Closed Principle:* Software should be open for extension but closed for modification.

***L**iskov Substitution Principle:* Objects that implement the same interface should be interchangeable without breaking the program.

***I**nterface Segregation Principle:* Your code should only depend on interfaces that it actually uses.

***D**ependency Inversion Principle:* All parts of your code should depend on interfaces, or abstractions. Implementation details should depend on interfaces, not the other way around.
